The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the functionalities of resource management and job
scheduling/monitoring into separate daemons. The idea is to have a global ResourceManager and per-application per-
ApplicationMaster. An application is either a single job or a (Directed Acyclic Graph) DAG
of jobs.

The ResourceManager and the NodeManager form the data-computation framework. The
ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the
system. The NodeManager is the per-machine framework agent who is responsible for containers,
monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the
ResourceManager Scheduler.

The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with
negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager to execute and
monitor the tasks.
